## Overview

SafeTree Adventure Therapy is a service offering alternative therapy to vulnerable young people in the community across Ireland.

We are specialised in trauma-informed care, and we create family-focused and goal-oriented experiences in natural environments to build up resilience in young people, improve family functioning and promote long-term positive change.

---

## User Stories

### Story 1

> "_I am a psychologist working with a high-risk young person who's parents are struggling to care for his needs. He is refusing traditional therapeutic intervention. I want to source a service that will provide benefits for him and his family._""

### Story 2

> "_I am a social worker. I want to find a service for a young person in care to try and improve and maintain their foster placement. The young person has sensory difficulties and I am hoping to apply for funding to a service that can support them in a peaceful, nature-based environment._"

### Story 3

> "_I am a parent and I am worried about the recent behavioural changes in my child. I do not want to bring them to a doctor or therapist but want to find something that can help us as a family manage this disruptive behaviour and bring us closer together._"

---

## User Experience (UX)

This website will be aimed primarily at professionals working with children or parents.

Whilst the service is aimed at children, it is an organisation of skilled, professional workers completing complex trauma-informed work, so it must appear child-friendly, but yet polished and not 'childish'.

---

### 1. Strategy

#### Why do we want to build the project?

- The primary aim of the site is to encourage customers to make contact with our service to discuss a potential case/referral.
- We want to clearly identify our skills as a service in meeting the needs of vulnerable young people.
- The website should have a focus on visually highlighting the environments that adventure therapy takes place in, as this is a key and unique element of the service and is a primary factor that would entice customers to make contact.

#### What are the needs of our users?

- Users searching for 'alternative therapy' or 'adventure therapy' need to find out how we can meet their needs.
- Users will need to discuss their unique case with a representative from our team
- Users will need to know where our service is in relation to them
- Users will want a smooth browsing experience free of anything that will hinder their understanding of our service

#### Special Considerations

- Due to the nature of the service, any visuals used must be anonymous and not containing clearly identifiable children/adults
- The site should not contain pricing as it should not present as a commercial price focused on profit _and_ every programme is unique and thus will be uniquely costed.

---

### 2. Scope

Considering the strategy of our website and the users' needs as outlined, our website should:

- Clearly outline what our company does, what are our skills as professionals and what is the service that is offered to young people referred to us.
- Provide contact details for making a referral to our service and these should be clearly visible and immediately accessible
  - Also include an integrated contact for immediate communication
- Clearly outline where our service operates and provide locations of our office bases
- be fully responsive for mobile use
- Have clearly visible links for the user to each relevant section of the page
- be built using best practices in terms of semantic HTML and accessibility.

---

### 3. Structure

The website should split into three areas. Considering the purpose of the website, these areas are of equal focus and priority.

- An Info Section
  - This section should clearly outlines what our company does, what are our skills as professionals and what is the service that is offered to young people referred to us.
- A Gallery Section
  - A visual presentation of what young people and families expect to experience on our programmes, highlighting the unique environments.
- A Contact Section
  - Contact details for making a referral to our service should be clearly visible and immediately accessible
  - An integrated contact form for making direct communication from the page itself

- [Mobile Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/9b32089f7389693#4eskckkd)
- [Tablet Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/9b32089f7389693#s1exq272)
- [Desktop Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/9b32089f7389693#pvh1r37l)

The website will be organised into the three sections above within a single scroll-able page.

A single page design works best, as it will allow users the best opportunity to take in each section of content.

This is particularly beneficial for first-time visitors as the information and visual sections both complement each other in terms of content.

The navigation links will allow users to jump to any particular section of the page, particularly for those who know of our service and simply want to make contact.

#### Changes to Wireframes

Following initial testing, I made two significant changes to the original wireframes:

- In landscape/desktop mode I added an additional image to the hero section rather than having a blank section. This worked better with the navbar and was much more vibrant.
- In tablet mode, I did not continue with having two cards next to each other side by side. This did not fit with the text content in the web page. Having larger cards fit the page better, and brought more focus to the photos incorporated in each about section card.

### 5. Surface

#### Fonts

For the title/headings I chose ['Norwester' by Jamie Wilson](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/norwester). The mix of small and large uppercase letters is 'child-friendly' in terms of typography. It has the appearance of being hand-crafted whilst also being reminiscent of old western 'adventure' films, which fits with the theme.

For the paragraph font I chose ['Roboto' font by Christian Robertson](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto). A clean and legible all-purpose sans-serif font.

#### Colour Scheme

**Primary Colour** | #20503C | a dark, mossy green inspired by Ireland and nature

**Secondary Colour** | #F1AE42 | a golden yellow, to represent sunlight, and offer a good contrast to the primary green and to brighten up the page without being too harsh

**White Colour** | #F8F8F8 | a softer white colour to prevent harshness in the blank spaces of the page and improve readability

#### Animation

Considering the importance of visuals for this website, I implemented animations into the initial page load.

The navbar animation is likened to the 'opening of a book' to create a more immersive experience on entry to the website - initially prioritising the _SafeTree_ logo and title before bringing the hero image info primary focus.

## Testing

Extensive testing took place to ensure that the page was fully functional, accessible and responsive.

- Use of Chrome Dev Tools to test responsiveness on multiple devices, ranging from simulated Galaxy Fold (280px width) to a simulated 4K resolution (3840px width).
  - Following issues raised in terms of contrast, I altered the [color scheme to ensure full accessibility](https://github.com/cjcon90/safetree/tree/main/docs/colors)
  - Ensured text remained visible during webfont load with [font-display: swap](https://web.dev/font-display/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools)
- Using the Tab key to navigate through the entire page to ensure that every link was accessible with the use of tab and highlighted when focused
- Tested contact form validation by submitting invalid data
- Testing every internal link on the page to ensure that it works (with mouse click and Tab)
  - Logo link to the top of the page
  - Navbar links
  - Image links to load the full-size image
  - Contact form inputs
  - mailto: links in the contact section
  - footer links
- Changing image shown for different viewports in srcset to ensure that it was working at different resolutions
- Testing markup on [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Testing CSS on [Jigsaw CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- Testing page with Lighthouse in Chrome Dev Tools to optimise performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO
  - Lighthouse highlighted performance issues with images not being resized properly, particularly in mobile, however when I made images smaller as suggested there was a noticeable lack of definition, leading me to keep the larger sized images.
  - Lighthouse Report (full report in repo docs/lighthouse folder):
    - ![Lighthouse Report](https://res.cloudinary.com/cjcon90/image/upload/v1604853888/codeinstitute/safetree/lighthouse-report-8-11-20_jhb2jd.png)
- Ran CSS through auto-prefixer, and saved the result as a separate .css file
  - Linked HTML to prefixed .css file before pushing to GitHub. Kept original CSS file for future editing.

## Bugs & Fixes

**Bug:** Scrolling on mobile was laggy due to large gallery image sizes.

**Fix:** Used _cwebp_ and _ImageMagick_ to create loops in bash terminal to optimise all images for the website.

- Large resize loop:
  - `for f in * ; do convert $f -scale 30% lg/$f ; done`
- Medium resize loop:
  - `for f in * ; do convert $f -scale 20% md/$f ; done`
- Small resize loop:
  - `for f in * ; do convert $f -scale 10% sm/$f ; done`
- Batch convert files to .webp in each new directory:
  - `for i in {1..20}; do cwebp -q 100 photo-"${i}".jpg -o photo-"${i}".webp; done`

---

**Bug:** If the page was refreshed after a user had navigated to #about, #gallery or #contact internal links - the navbar animation would take up the whole screen despite not being at the top of the page.

**Fix:** I altered the animation to make the navbar begin with absolute positioning and then switch to fixed once it had reduced to it's regular size.

```css
@keyframes navbar-start {
  0% {
    height: 100vh;
    position: absolute;
  }
  99% {
    position: absolute;
  }
  100% {
    height: 10vh;
    position: fixed;
  }
}
```

---

**Bug:** Input boxes moved position when adding a border to highlight when they were focused or active
**Fix**: Added a transparent border to input boxes when not focused or active

---

**Bug:** Fixed navbar was going underneath title text when scrolling/
**Fix:** Made navbar `z-index: 100` and then added `z-index` change to title text during animation:

```css
@keyframes title-start {
  0% {
    top: 60%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    z-index: 101; /*TEXT STARTS ABOVE NAVBAR*/
    background-color: transparent;
  }

  50% {
    background-color: transparent;
  100% {
    top: 60%;
    left: 0%;
    transform: translate(0, -50%);
    z-index: 99; /*TEXT ENDS BELOW NAVBAR*/
    background-color: var(--color-primary-fade);
  }
}
```
