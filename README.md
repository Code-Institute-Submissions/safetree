## Overview

SafeTree Adventure Therapy is a service offering alternative therapy to vulnerable young people in the community across Ireland.

We are specialised in trauma-informed care, and we create family-focused and goal-oriented experiences in natural environments to build up resilience in young people, improve family functioning and promote long-term positive change.

## User Stories

### Story 1
>"*I am a psychologist working with a high risk young person who's parents are struggling to care for his needs. He is refusing traditional therapeutic intervention. I want to source a service that will provide benefits for him and his family.*""
### Story 2
>"*I am a  social worker. I want to find a service for a young person in care to try and improve and maintain their foster placement. The young person has sensory difficulties and I am hoping to apply for funding to a service that can support them in a peaceful, nature based environment.*" 
### Story 3
>"*I am a parent and I am worried about the recent behavioural changes in my child. I do not want to bring them to a doctor or therapist but want to find something that can help us as a family manage this disruptive behaviour and bring us closer together.*"

## User Experience (UX)

This website will be aimed primarily at professionals working with children or parents.

Whilst the service is aimed at children, it is an organisation of skilled, professional workers completing complex trauma-informed work, so it must appear child-friendly, but yet polished and not 'childish'.

### 1. Strategy

#### Why do we want to build the project?

- The primary aim of the site is to encourage customers to make contact with our service to discuss a potential case/referral.
- We want to clearly identify our skills as a service in meeting the needs of vulnerable young people.
- The website should have a focus on visually highlighting the environments that adventure therapy takes place in, as this is a key and unique element of the service and is a primary factor that would entice customers to make contact.

#### What are the needs of our users?

- Users searching for 'alternative therapy' or 'adventure therapy' need to find out how we can meet their needs.
- Users will need to discuss their unique case with a representative from our team
- Users will need to know where our service is in relation to them
- Users will want a smooth browsing experience free of anything that will hinder their understanding of our service

#### Special Considerations
- Due to the nature of the  service, any visuals used must be anonymous and not containing clearly identifiable children/adults
- The site should not contain pricing as it should not present as a commercial price focused on profit *and* every programme is unique and thus will be uniquely costed.

---

### 2. Scope

Considering the strategy of our website and the users' needs as outlined, our website should:
- Clearly outline what our company does, what are our skills as professionals and what is the service that is offered to young people referred to us.
- Provide contact details for making a referral to our service and these should be clearly visible and immediately accessible
	- Also include an integrated contact for for immediate communication
- Clearly outline where our service operates and provide locations of our office bases  
- be fully responsive for mobile use
- Have clearly visible links for the user to each relevant section of the page
- be built using best practices in terms of semantic HTML and accessibility.

---

### 3. Structure
The website should split into three areas. Considering the purpose of the website, these  areas are of equal focus and priority.
- An Info Section
	- This section should clearly outlines what our company does, what are our skills as professionals and what is the service that is offered to young people referred to us.
- A Gallery Section
	-  A visual presentation of what young people and families expect to experience on our programmes, highlighting the unique environments.
- A Contact Section
	-  Contact details for making a referral to our service should be clearly visible and immediately accessible
	- An integrated contact form for making direct communication from the page itself

- [Desktop Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/9b32089f7389693#pvh1r37l)

The website will be organised into the three sections above within a single scroll-able page.

A single page design works best, as the it will allow users the best opportunity to take in  each section of content.

This is particularly beneficial for first time visitors as the information and visual sections both complement each other in terms of content.

The navigation links will allow users to jump to any particular section of the page, particularly for those who know of our service and simply want to make contact.

### 5. Surface

#### Fonts

For the title/headings I chose ['Norwester' by Jamie Wilson](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/norwester). The mix of small and large uppercase letters is 'child-friendly' in terms of typography. It has an appearance of being hand-crafted whilst also being reminiscent of old western 'adventure' films, which fits with the theme.

For the paragraph font I chose ['Lato' by  ≈Åukasz Dziedzic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato). A clean and legible all purpose sans-serif font.

#### Colour Scheme

**Primary Colour** | #295C47 | a dark, mossy green inspired by Ireland and nature

**Secondary Colour** | #F6B040 | a golden yellow, to represent sun to brighten up the page without being too harsh

**White Colour** | #F8F8F8 | a softer white colour to prevent harshness in the blank spaces of the page and improve readability
